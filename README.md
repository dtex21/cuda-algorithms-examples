# CUDA - Algorithms & Examples
A university project about parallel algorithms in C/C++, using CUDA enabled GPU's.
Includes the following implementations: BFS, Bitonic Sort, Cash-Karp Method, Euler Method, Runge-Kutta Method, Flag example based on the VBO sample of Nvidia. 

Use the makefile (make -f makefile) to compile all the files at once.
